# UI

## Verifying visual work

- Verify every visual change with an agent-browser screenshot (light + dark, and
  mobile viewport where relevant) before reporting it done. Never make the user
  act as the renderer.
- Any change to a Blade view, Livewire component, or Filament page must be
  clicked through with agent-browser (including empty-state data) before being
  reported done. Tests passing is not sufficient for UI work.
- agent-browser and the Browser suite both drive Chromium, and CI installs
  Chromium only (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). A defect that only WebKit shows
  passes every gate. After the Chromium pass, run the browser tests for the
  surfaces you changed in WebKit:
  `php artisan test --compact <files> --browser safari`. Install the engine once
  per machine with `pnpm exec playwright install webkit`.
- An SVG that reaches the page as a string (`svg()->toHtml()` inside `@js`, a
  JavaScript template) carries its own size class:
  `svg('ri-claude-fill', 'size-full')`. With only a `viewBox`, Chromium stretches
  it to its flex slot and WebKit collapses it to 0x0.
  `tests/Browser/Chat/ModelPickerTest.php` fails under `--browser safari` when a
  model picker icon loses its size.
- A visual bug the reporter sees and agent-browser does not show is an engine
  difference until proven otherwise. Reproduce it in WebKit before changing
  code, then re-run that repro after the fix.

## Marketing & demo surfaces

- Mockups of the product (hero tabs, demos) mirror the real app UI 1:1.
  Screenshot the actual app first and match sidebar, spacing, and component
  placement. External sites (e.g. attio.com) are inspiration for concept only,
  never for visual specifics.
- Use design tokens from `resources/css/theme.css`; don't introduce ad-hoc pixel
  values or colors without a semantic token.
- Demo/example content (names, companies, conversations) must read like real CRM
  data for the buyer persona. No placeholder-looking values.

## Icons (Remix Icon)

- **Brand/social icons** (GitHub, Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn) → always `fill` variant
- **UI/functional icons** (arrows, chevrons, checks, close) → always `line` variant
- **Feature/section icons** → `line` variant, stay consistent within a section
- **Status/emphasis icons** (success checkmarks, alerts) → `fill` variant
